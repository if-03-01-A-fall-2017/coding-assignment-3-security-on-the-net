            <p>Identity theft has reached epidemic levels in the UK, with incidents of this type of fraud running
               at almost 500 a day, according to the latest figures.During the first six months of this year there
               were a record 89,000 cases of identity fraud, which typically involves criminals pretending to be an
               individual in order to steal their money, buy items or take out a loan or car insurance in their name.
               The fraud prevention service Cifas, which issued the data, said these crimes were taking place almost
               exclusively online, and that the vast amount of personal data available on the internet and as a result
               of data breaches “is only making it easier for the fraudster”.</p>
